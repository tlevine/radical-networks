## Speaker Bio

Thomas Levine is a dada artist who really likes to sleep.
His interests in dada and sleep are
largely a rebellion against his upbringing in America
that valued hard work and generally embodied the
[Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic).
When he isn't sleeping, he often develops experimental lifestyles and
life-automation software in an effort to give himself more time to sleep.
